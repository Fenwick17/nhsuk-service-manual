    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">1. Understand users and their needs in the context of health and care</h3>
    <p>Take time to understand your users' clinical, practical and emotional needs - and abilities - and how you can help them manage their own health better. Take account of the needs of partners, carers and health professionals too.</p>

    <p>Consider where your service fits in your users' healthcare journey and whether you could support or influence a wider solution.</p>
    <p>Start small and deliver value to users quickly but work towards creating a service that solves one whole problem for users. If necessary, collaborate across programme and organisational boundaries.</p>

    <p>Evaluate what data and information your service will be collecting, storing and providing.</p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">11. Define what success looks like and publish performance data</h3>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">14. Use and contribute to common standards, components and patterns</h3>

    <p>Use tried and tested components and patterns from <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/patterns/">the NHS digital service manual</a> or, failing that, <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">the GOV.UK design system</a>.
