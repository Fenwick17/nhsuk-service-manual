    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Digital services are not excluded from the NHS commitment to care and compassion. Small things make a difference when people are, for example, sick or stressed, grieving or dying.</p>
    <p>We can improve people's experience of care by being inclusive and treating them with respect.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you listen and understand your users' needs and take their fears and frustrations seriously</li>
      <li>you think carefully about their context and circumstances</li>
      <li>you <a href="/service-manual/service-standard/3-make-the-service-easy-to-use">make things simple</a></li>
      <li>you are inclusive and respectful</li>
      <li>your service balances helping users complete the task with an appropriate tone of voice, reassurance, clear explanations and signposting to support</li>
      <li>your service doesn't do anything that is better done face to face</li>
    </ul>
