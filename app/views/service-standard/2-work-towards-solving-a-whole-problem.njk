    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>The health service is complex. People often don't know how NHS organisations and services fit together. It helps if you can bring things together into a journey which makes sense to users, irrespective of which organisation they "belong" to. Because users shouldn't have to understand how the NHS works to get the help they need.</p>
    <p>You may not be able to fix a whole problem, but you may be able to improve it and to support or influence a wider solution.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you understand where the user need you're addressing fits into wider healthcare journeys or how it will join up with other things to solve a whole problem for users</li>
      <li>you have tried to minimise the number of times users provide the same information to NHS services (while respecting users' privacy)</li>
      <li>the scope of your product or service is based on how users think - not too wide and not too narrow</li>
      <li>you have considered alternatives to creating a service - for example, publishing website content, running a health campaign, partnering with another organisation, making data or an API available to third parties - or doing nothing</li>
      <li>your service is viable</li>
      <li>you understand any constraints, including legislation, and work with policy colleagues to solve problems the constraints are causing</li>
      <li>if your research suggests a different approach or if policy or other constraints limit what you can do, you have shared this with your stakeholders</li>
      <li>you have built relationships with other teams and organisations and considered whether working with them would make your service more effective</li>
      <li>you work in the open so that people outside the organisation know what you are doing</li>
    </ul>
