    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>NHS digital services often hold personal and sensitive information about users. The NHS has a legal duty to protect this information. Failing to do so would undermine public trust in the NHS. </p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your service complies with GDPR</li>
      <li>you are aware of and, if appropriate, comply with NHS specific <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance">guidance on data security and information governance</a></li>
      <li>you actively identify security and privacy threats to the service and have a robust, proportionate approach to securing information and managing fraud risks</li>
      <li>you have a plan and budget that lets you manage security during the life of the service (for example by responding to new threats, putting controls in place and applying security patches to software)</li>
      <li>collect and process user's personal information in a way that's secure and respects their privacy</li>
    </ul>
