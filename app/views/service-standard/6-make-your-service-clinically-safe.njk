    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Digital services in the NHS must be safe and meet clinical safety standards.</p>
    <p>Inaccurate or out of date data can frustrate users or cause patient harm.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have access to a nominated clinical safety officer who has been trained in clinical risk management and is accountable for clinical safety</li>
      <li>qualified clinicians check your clinical information and make sure that it is accurate and clinically safe</li>
      <li>if your nominated clinician advises you to, you work to <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems">DCB0129</a> (the safety standard for manufacturers of health IT software) or <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0160-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-deployment-and-use-of-health-it-systems">DCB0160</a> (the standard which helps health and care organisations assure the clinical safety of their health IT software) - or both</li>
       <li>your processes, for example, for reviewing clinical risk, managing live safety incidents and for making sure any data you collect is up to date and error free comply with the relevant clinical safety standard</li>
       <li>where appropriate, you comply with NICE's <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/evidence-standards-framework-for-digital-health-technologies">Evidence standards framework for digital health technologies</a></li>

      <li>if you provide online primary care services, you have registered with the Care Quality Commission</li>
      <li>if your app is a medical device, you follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-devices-software-applications-apps">guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regularly Agency (MHRA)</a></li>
    </ul>
