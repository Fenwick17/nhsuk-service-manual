    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>We need to be sure that digital services in the NHS are safe and meet clinical safety standaards.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have a clinician attached to the team who has been trained in clinical risk management and is accountable for clinical safety</li>
      <li>qualified clinicians check your clinical information and make sure that it is accurate, clinically safe and has been developed using relevant evidence-based guidance</li>
      <li>you have an agreed process in place for documenting and reviewing risk and managing live safety incidents</li>
      <li>you have processes for making sure that any data you collect is kept up to date and accurate and that you have mechanisms in place for identifying and correcting errors</li>
      <li>if your nominated clinician advises you to, you work to the two health IT clinical safety standards: <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems">DCB0219</a> and <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0160-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-deployment-and-use-of-health-it-systems">DCB0160</a> and, where appropriate, you comply with NICE's <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/evidence-standards-framework-for-digital-health-technologies">Evidence standards framework for digital health technologies</a></li>
    </ul>
