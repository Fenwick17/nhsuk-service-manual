    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>NHS services are for everyone. We have a legal duty to consider everyone’s needs when we’re designing and delivering services.</p>
    <p>Inclusive, accessible services are better for everyone. For example, using simple words helps people who are sick or stressed as well as people who have a learning disability.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your service meets accessibility standards, for both online and offline parts</li>
      <li>you understand who are the most vulnerable users for your service and include them in user research, for example: people with access needs, people with low socio-economic status (D and E), older people and black and minority ethnic audiences</li>
      <li>you avoid excluding any groups your service serves - or making people feel excluded</li>
      <li>you make sure that people aren’t excluded because they lack digital skills or internet access and you provide assisted digital support to cover any gaps</li>
      <li>you design for low digital and health literacy</li>
    </ul>
