    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Having clear objectives, a definition of what success looks like and appropriate metrics means that you’ll know whether the service is solving the problem it’s meant to solve.</p>
    <p>Collecting the right information will alert you to improvements you need to make and help you know if changes have the effect you intend.</p>
    <p>Publishing performance information means that you’re being transparent about the success of services funded by public money.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are clear what your objectives are and the outcomes you will be measuring, for example by reducing pressure on the front line</li>
      <li>have identified appropriate metrics and are tracking performance against them</li>
      <li>use performance data to make decisions about how to fix problems and improve the service</li>
      <li>publish performance information</li>
    </ul>
