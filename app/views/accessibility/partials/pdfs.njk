<h2 id="pdfs">Use HTML instead of or in addition to a PDF</h2>
<p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/content">Content</a>, <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/testing">Testing</a></p>
<p>We advise against using PDFs unless you absolutely have to due to their poor accessibility. If you must use a PDF, you must make sure the content is also available in HTML form.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="/service-manual/content/pdfs">content style guide page on PDFs</a>.</p>
