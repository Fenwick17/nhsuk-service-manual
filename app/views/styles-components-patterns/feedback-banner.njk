    <h2 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">How to use the feedback banner</h2>
        <p>Make sure the feedback banner doesn't appear until the user has agreed to use the appropriate cookies.</p>
        <p>Include a descriptive heading.</p>
        <p>Make the feedback/survey link text describe its purpose and destination.</p>
        <p>Add hidden text to the close button to give screen readers context.</p>
    <h2>When not to use the feedback banner</h2>
        <p>Do not use in states of emergency - when emergency messages are shown to a user.</p>
        <p>Do not use the  banner when displaying messages that suggest users get emergency healthcare. </p>
        <p>In both cases, the  banner could detract from the importance of the messaging.</p>

    <h2>How the  banner works</h2>
        <p>The banner appears 5 seconds after a user lands on the page.  </p>
        <p>The banner should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>appear after the users’ journey – so we don’t annoy them (too much)</li>
                <li>be prominent – so they notice it</li>
                <li>be able to close (dismiss) it</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>exceeds AAA colour contrast guidelines with its text colour</li>
            <li>exceeds AA colour contrast guidelines with its link colour (just short of AAA)</li>
            <li>has a ‘Close’ action is button and not a link. Find out more about accessible links and buttons</li>
            <li>includes hidden text within the ‘Close’ button to give screen readers context, for example: ‘Close feedback invite’</li>
            <li>has a descriptive heading (h2)</li>
            <li>includes link text that describes its purpose and destination.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>The pagination component was tested in the context of a condition information guide (grouped pages on same subject) in three labs: 20th June 2018, 4th July 2018 and 16th July 2018.</p>
    <p>This component hasn't been tested on forms or 'related' pages.</p>
    <p>In a user research lab, 4/5 users, including a user with very low digital skills – used pagination to navigate through pages, and knew this was associated with the navigation at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>Users found the pagination particularly useful for navigating based on the way they read content and it supporting their mental model of the guide structure. </p>
