    <h2 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">When to use a back link</h2>
    <p>Back links are only used on transactional services or multi page forms.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/">GOV.UK design system</a> recommends including a back link on question pages. Read more about <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages">question pages on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
    <p>You can include a back link on other pages in a multi-page transaction, if it makes sense to do so.</p>
    <p>Make sure the text used in the link describes the action, for example "Go back".</p>
    <h2>When not to use a back link</h2>
    <p>Do not use a back link with breadcrumbs. Carry out research with your users to find out what helps them most.</p>
    <p>Consider where you put the back link. Do not put it close to other links or buttons where it might distract users from what they need to do.</p>
    <h2>How to use back links</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/">GOV.UK design system</a> says that back links should always go at the top of a page, but a couple of NHS services (<a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online</a> and <a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk">Find out why your NHS data matters</a>) have found that it works better at the bottom of the page below the primary action. That's because we don't want to suggest to people who use a screen reader that they leave the page prematurely.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>When you're considering where to put back link on a page, think about people who use a screen reader.</p>
    <p>Also, make sure the text you use describes the action. Do not rely on "Go back". It might not reflect what users expect.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>During testing, <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online</a> found that some users wanted to change their answers, so they introduced a back link and labelled it to "Change my previous answer".</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre</a> recommended that <a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk/">Find out why your NHS data matters</a> place their back link below the primary action, because screen reader users were confused when they landed on a page and were immediately told to go back.</p>
