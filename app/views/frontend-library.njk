    <h2>About the NHS.UK frontend library</h2>
    <p>The frontend library contains the production code for NHS.UK. We've made it public in an open code "repository" in GitHub.</p>
    <h3>Why use the frontend library?</h3>
    <p>It will help you build responsive websites with a consistent NHS look and feel. It saves you duplicating effort and should help you build services faster, saving the NHS money.</p>
    <h3>What are the advantages of this code?</h3>
    <p>The code you get is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>high quality</b> - it's been checked by the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/">Government Digital Service</a> and industry CSS experts</li>
      <li><b>user centred</b> - it's designed to meet user needs and tested with real users</li>
      <li><b>well designed</b> - it reflects the NHS brand and values</li>
      <li><b>accessible</b> - it meets WCAG AA standard and AAA where possible</b></li>
      <li><b>tested</b> - across different browsers and devices</li>
      <li><b>modern</b> - it's built with HTML5 semantics</li>
      <li><b>responsive</b> - with a mobile-first design</li>
      <li><b>robust</b> - it has browser support for earlier versions and no-js fallbacks</li>
      <li><b>modular</b> - you choose the components you need</li>
      <li><b>versioned</b> - you only need to upgrade when you're ready</li>
      <li><b>optimised</b> - so that pages load quickly</li>
      <li><b>open source</b> - we share our learning and are transparent in our decisions</li>
      <li><b>up-to-date and supported</b> - it's maintained by developers working on the NHS website and continuously improved by a community of people committed to sharing quality code in the NHS</li>

    </ul>
